1 full BOCU (3) in the northwest corner. A couple potentially smaller grazed down ones throughout as well as a couple potential ARPUs (2),2
1 Possible PLJA (1 out of 3 on certainty) on south border as well as some BOCUs (might be BOER but probably BOCU or other BOsp.) Mostly grazed,2
3 individual ARPUs  and a BOCU,2
A couple BOCUs and a couple potential BOCU nubs and a possible ARPU,2
"A couple small SECOs mostly near conmods and possiblya young POSE near SE conmod, Also decent size patch (~1% cover) of SECO just near/outside N edge",2
A few ARPUs and young BOCUs mostly near/in the south half except for a smaller ARPU in the northwest and a BAMU just north of subplot,3
ARPU about 5 individuals and an individual BAMU resprouting at base,2
"ARPU many individuals, BAMU 1 individual, PLMU (2) 1 individual, ACHY (2) 1 individual",4
Couple medium sized ARPUs (not completely sure 2/3 on certainty of ID) and a large BOCU right next to the NW plot marker rooted just outside of the plot but some overhangs into the plot,2
Couple small to medium ARPUs throughout and a couple small SECOs in N half of the plot typically hidden under/using ERCU as a shade plant,3
Extra large to medium large BOCUs throughout and at least 2 tiny SECO near/in SE pit and NE/subplot pit,2
Large BOCU in the southeast with a few small ones throughout and about 5 ARPUs small to large in size that're mostly near the conmods,2
"Medium SECO in/near NW pit with a couple tiny seedlings scattered throughout, medium BAMU in the middle, a few small to medium/large ARPUs sprinkled throughout, possibly a small ACHY in SE section (wirey leaf blades that clasp the stem, hairs at the node, only one seed head but similar to examples)",4
Medium sized BOCU and ARPU,2
Medium to large ARPUs throughout and a couple small and medium BOCUs near the N conmods and a few teeny tiny SECOs near conmods as well,3
"Multiple ARPUs small to large sized throughout, possible ACHY in the SE pit, and a couple teeny tiny SECOs in/around some of the pits",3
Multiple BOCU's medium-large and a possible medium sized ARPU,2
Multiple med to extra large BOCUs and a few small to large ARPUs,2
Multiple medium to extra large ARPUs and large BAMU along the N edge of the plot along with possible tiny seedlings in same pits,2
Multiple medium to large ARPU and small/medium BOCU near the NE corner and a couple tiny SECOs,3
Multiple small to large ARPUs throughout along with a large BAMU in center and a medium sized BOCU in the NW section,2
Multiple small to medium ARPUs and BOCUs along with a possible PLMU (rough feeling leaves and similar seeds) with a couple small/medium BAMU that are in or near the N half of the pits and a couple small SECO seedlings sprinkled throughout,5
Possible ACHY near southwest corner (2 certainty) and about 10 ARPU small to medium in size with 2 of them next to the subplot but not quite in,2
"Possible ARPUs, SECO seedling in subplot",2
"Possible couple small ASTUs along with multiple medium to extra large ARPUs, possibly a few BAMU seedlings as well as a couple tiny to small SECOs throughout",4
"Possible SPCR in subplot, Blue not Black grama",2
Possible young BOCU and ARPU but no seed heads yet therfor unsure ifit is than seeded species cover is 1% but if not it's trace amount because of a few SECOs all found in or near pits,3
"Possibly small POSE and SPCR in the S half of the plot, BLUE grama not BLACK",3
Quite a few small tp extra large BOCUs throughout along with a possible ASTU,2
Small to large ARPUs and BOCUs along with a couple small SECOs as well as a possible PLMU in the middle (rough feeling and membranous ligule but no seed heads),4
Small to large ARPUs throughout along with a tiny baby SECO seedling in SE section,2
Small to large ARPUs throughout and a couple of small SECOs,2
Small to medium ARPUs throughout and a few tiny to small SECOs mostly near the conmods,2
Small to medium ARPUs throughout and small/medium BAMU near the NE edge,2
Small/medium to large ARPUs and small to large BOCU throughout,2
Some type of Aristida possibly and ARPU and maybe 1 small maybe BOCU near subplot that's been grazed down,3
Southwest pit has 1 BAMU and 4 small ARPUs. Northwest pit has 2 medium and 2 small ARPUs and 1 dreid up SECO. There are a few more small to medium sized ARPUs throughout,3
SW conmod is overgrown with Blue grama but NO black grama but thee's a possible young PEPA by the NW conmod,2
