Notes about raw data for RAMPS RestoreNet project:

# Directory
`lifeform-na_edited.csv`
- Manually edited version of `lifeform-na_output.csv`, created to assign lifeform (functional group) to plant species based on existing labels from subplot data from `Master`.
- Lifeform according to USDA Plants.

`lifeform-na_output.csv`
- List of species without lifeform (functional group) assignment from the species mix data (`seed-mix.csv`) or fromthe subplot data from `Master`.

`Master Germination Data 2022.xlsx`
- Received from Hannah Farrell via email. I believe this is what she used to write her paper, which is currently in review.
- File will not be modified in any way.  
  

`plant-species_native-status.xlsx`
- Adapted from the `Species_Definitions` tab of `Master`.
- I added the `Native` column based on USDA Plants databse, and did small corrections to spelling of scientific names.
- I did not change any species codes, as they relate directly to the `Master` data.

`seed-mix.xlsx`
- Adapted from the `Seed Mixes` tab of `Master`.

`species-unique_native-lifeform_output.csv`
- List of unique species codes (although there are some duplicates when there are conflicting lifeforms or names for the same code).

`species-unique_native-lifeform-duration_edited.csv`
- Manually edited list to resolve conflicting lifeform assignments, and added plant duration based on USDA Plants.
