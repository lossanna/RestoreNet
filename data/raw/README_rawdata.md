Notes about raw data for RAMPS RestoreNet project:

`Master Germination Data 2022.xlsx`
- Received from Hannah Farrell via email. I believe this is what she used to write her paper, which is currently in review.
- File will not be modified in any way.  
  

`plant-species.xlsx`
- Adapted from the `Species_Definitions` tab of `Master`.
- I added the `Native` column based on USDA Plants databse, and did small corrections to spelling of scientific names.
- I did not change any species codes, as they relate directly to the `Master` data.

`seed-mix.xlsx`
- Adapted from the `Seed Mixes` tab of `Master`.
