Data wrangling using the data Hannah Farrell sent me in spring 2022 (`Master Germination Data 2022.xlsx`), which has now been replaced with what Laura Shriver sent me 2023-09-15 (`Master 1.0 Germination Data_raw`). Laura (current manager of RestoreNet) sent me files that include data from 2023.

See the README files for the `data/raw/` and `data/data-wrangling-intermediate` for explanations of the files and workflow. I produced cleaned `subplot` data, but did not get all the way through the `2x2` data cleaning before deciding to switch to Laura's data.
