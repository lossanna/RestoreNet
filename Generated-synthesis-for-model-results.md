# Sonoran Desert
## 1. Desirable vs. Weedy Height
Refers to the model summary output of GLMs with:
 - Random effects of nexted `(1|Site/Plot)` included.
 - Transformation of `AridityIndex` and `Cum_precip` to improve normality.
 - Variables causing collinearity issues have been dropped.

Generated on 2024-08-29:
- From `08.2_generalized-linear-models-2.0_subplot-Height.R`:
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Desirable: `nb.sonoran1.des` model
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Weedy: `nb.sonoran1.weed` model

I asked it to compare and contrast the results of the two models.

### Response generated:
Let's compare and contrast the results from the two models, one focusing on desirable species and the other on weedy species. The comparison will help to highlight differences in how environmental variables and treatments influence the height of these different types of plants.

### **Model Overview:**
- **Response Variable in Both Models:** `Height` (log-transformed, negative binomial distribution).
- **Key Predictors in Both Models:** `Perc_dev_cum`, `Treatment`, `PlantSource2`, `Duration`, `Lifeform`, `MAT`, `Sand_content`, `Cum_precip_sqrt`.
- **Weedy Species Model:** Adds `AridityIndex_log` as a predictor, which wasn't included in the desirable species model.

### **Key Comparisons:**

#### **1. Model Fit and Random Effects:**
- **AIC & BIC:**
  - **Desirable Species:** AIC = 26,964.8, BIC = 27,084.2
  - **Weedy Species:** AIC = 12,942.8, BIC = 13,049.5
  - **Interpretation:** The weedy species model has much lower AIC and BIC values, indicating a better fit for the data relative to the desirable species model. However, these values are not directly comparable due to different data and predictors.

- **Random Effects:**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - Variance for Plot:Site = 0.01208, Site = 0.01369
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - Variance for Plot:Site = 0.05697, Site = 0.01596
  - **Interpretation:** The random effects variance is higher in the weedy species model, especially at the Plot:Site level, suggesting more variability in weedy species height across different plots within sites compared to desirable species.

#### **2. Key Predictors:**

- **`Perc_dev_cum` (Percent Deviation of Cumulative Precipitation):**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - Estimate = 0.7036, p < 2e-12 ***
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - Estimate = 1.335, p < 2e-16 ***
  - **Interpretation:** The effect of `Perc_dev_cum` is stronger in weedy species than in desirable species, with a larger positive estimate in the weedy species model. This suggests that weedy species are even more responsive to deviations in cumulative precipitation, potentially thriving more in conditions of unusual precipitation.

- **`AridityIndex_log`:** 
  - **Weedy Species Only:** 
    - Estimate = 1.289, p = 0.02812 *
  - **Interpretation:** This predictor was not included in the desirable species model. In the weedy species model, it has a significant positive effect, indicating that areas with higher aridity (on a logarithmic scale) tend to have taller weedy species. This might suggest that weedy species are more adapted to or take advantage of arid conditions.

- **`Treatment`:**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - No treatment effects were significant.
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - Similarly, no treatment effects were significant.
  - **Interpretation:** In both models, the different treatments applied (e.g., mulch, pits, seed) did not significantly affect plant height, indicating that these interventions might not be effective in influencing height for either desirable or weedy species.

- **`PlantSource2`:**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - No significant effects for different plant sources.
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - `PlantSource2Recruit` is significant with a negative effect (Estimate = -0.6676, p < 5.57e-06 ***).
  - **Interpretation:** The source of weedy species (whether they are recruited naturally or from another source) has a significant impact, with recruited weedy species tending to be shorter. This difference was not observed in desirable species.

- **`Duration` (Perennial vs. Unknown):**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - `DurationPerennial` positive and significant; `DurationUnknown` negative and significant.
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - Similar trend: `DurationPerennial` is not significant; `DurationUnknown` is negative and significant.
  - **Interpretation:** Perennial plants tend to be taller in the desirable species model, whereas in weedy species, the unknown duration category has a consistent negative effect, indicating shorter heights.

- **`Lifeform`:**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - `LifeformGrass` significant and positive.
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - `LifeformGrass` significant and positive, but with a smaller effect size.
  - **Interpretation:** Grass lifeform is a significant predictor of height in both models, but its effect is stronger in desirable species.

- **`MAT` (Mean Annual Temperature):**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - Not significant.
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - Negative and borderline significant (p = 0.05532).
  - **Interpretation:** Temperature might have a slight negative effect on the height of weedy species, suggesting they might not grow as tall in warmer conditions. No effect was observed for desirable species.

- **`Sand_contentlow`:**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - Positive and significant.
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - Positive and highly significant (Estimate = 1.713, p < 9.96e-09 ***).
  - **Interpretation:** Low sand content in the soil significantly increases the height of both desirable and weedy species, with a much stronger effect in weedy species.

- **`Cum_precip_sqrt`:**
  - **Desirable Species:** 
    - Highly significant positive effect.
  - **Weedy Species:** 
    - Also highly significant, but with a smaller effect size.
  - **Interpretation:** Cumulative precipitation positively influences height in both groups, though the effect is somewhat stronger in desirable species.

### **Summary of Key Differences:**
- **Stronger Response to Precipitation Deviations:** Weedy species show a much stronger response to deviations in cumulative precipitation than desirable species.
- **Effect of Aridity:** Weedy species are positively influenced by arid conditions, suggesting they might be more adaptable or competitive in such environments.
- **Effect of Plant Source:** The negative effect of recruitment on the height of weedy species indicates that their growth might be suppressed when recruited, a pattern not observed in desirable species.
- **Soil Conditions:** Weedy species are more sensitive to low sand content, showing a stronger growth response than desirable species in such soils.

These differences highlight the varying ecological strategies and responses of desirable versus weedy species to environmental conditions and interventions. Would you like to explore any particular aspect of these results further?


## 2. All four models compared
Built off previous answer/conversation comparing just Height. Added Count results, and also mentioned these were restoration plots in the Sonoran Desert.

Refers to the model summary output of GLMs with:
 - Random effects of nexted `(1|Site/Plot)` included.
 - Transformation of `AridityIndex` and `Cum_precip` to improve normality.
 - Variables causing collinearity issues have been dropped.
    
Generated on 2024-08-29:
- From `08.1_generalized-linear-models-2.0_subplot-Count.R`:
    - Sonoran Desert, Count, Desirable: `nb.sonoran1.des`
    - Sonoran Desert, Count, Weedy: `nb.sonoran1.weed`
- From `08.2_generalized-linear-models-2.0_subplot-Height.R`:
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Desirable: `nb.sonoran1.des` model
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Weedy: `nb.sonoran1.weed` model

I asked it to compare all four models, considering both response variables of Height and Count.

### Response generated:

### **Synthesis of Overall Effects on Desirable vs. Weedy Species: Height and Count**

These models help to understand how different environmental factors and treatments influence the height and density (count) of both desirable and weedy species in restoration plots in the Sonoran Desert. Below is a summary of the effects:

### **1. Influence of Environmental Factors:**

#### **Percent Deviation of Cumulative Precipitation (`Perc_dev_cum`):**
- **Desirable Species:**
  - **Height:** Significant positive effect. Plants grow taller with greater deviation from average precipitation.
  - **Count:** Significant positive effect. Higher deviations increase plant density.
- **Weedy Species:**
  - **Height:** Significant positive effect, even stronger than in desirable species. Weedy species grow much taller with greater precipitation deviations.
  - **Count:** Significant **negative** effect. Surprisingly, higher precipitation deviations decrease the density of weedy species.
  
  **Interpretation:** Desirable species benefit in both height and density from increased precipitation deviations, whereas weedy species grow taller but with reduced density. This suggests that while weedy species can take advantage of favorable conditions for height, these conditions may lead to a more competitive environment that reduces their overall numbers.

#### **Aridity Index (`AridityIndex_log`):**
- **Desirable Species:**
  - **Height:** Not included in the model.
  - **Count:** Significant positive effect. Higher aridity increases plant density.
- **Weedy Species:**
  - **Height:** Significant positive effect. Weedy species grow taller in more arid conditions.
  - **Count:** No significant effect.
  
  **Interpretation:** Desirable species' density increases with aridity, whereas weedy species' height increases but their density does not. This suggests that desirable species might be more competitive in arid conditions, whereas weedy species might focus more on individual growth rather than population expansion.

#### **Mean Annual Temperature (`MAT`):**
- **Desirable Species:**
  - **Height:** Not significant.
  - **Count:** Significant positive effect. Warmer temperatures increase plant density.
- **Weedy Species:**
  - **Height:** Borderline negative effect (p = 0.055).
  - **Count:** Not significant.
  
  **Interpretation:** Desirable species' density benefits from warmer temperatures, whereas weedy species may be slightly inhibited in height by warmer conditions.

#### **Cumulative Precipitation (`Cum_precip_sqrt`):**
- **Desirable Species:**
  - **Height:** Significant positive effect. Taller plants with more cumulative precipitation.
  - **Count:** Significant positive effect. Higher density with more cumulative precipitation.
- **Weedy Species:**
  - **Height:** Significant positive effect. Taller weedy species with more cumulative precipitation.
  - **Count:** Significant negative effect. Lower density with more cumulative precipitation.
  
  **Interpretation:** Cumulative precipitation boosts both height and density in desirable species, while in weedy species, it increases height but reduces density. This could imply that weedy species become more competitive in height but less so in density under increased water availability.

### **2. Influence of Treatments:**

- **Desirable Species:**
  - **Height:** No significant treatment effects.
  - **Count:** `ConMod` and `Pits` treatments show significant positive effects on density, indicating these treatments might be effective for increasing the density of desirable species.

- **Weedy Species:**
  - **Height and Count:** No significant treatment effects for either height or density.
  
  **Interpretation:** Treatments such as `ConMod` and `Pits` can increase the density of desirable species but do not significantly affect the height or density of weedy species. This suggests that the interventions are more effective in promoting the desired vegetation without encouraging weedy species.

### **3. Influence of Soil and Plant Traits:**

- **Sand Content (`Sand_contentlow`):**
  - **Desirable Species:**
    - **Height:** Significant positive effect. Taller plants in low sand content areas.
    - **Count:** Negative effect but not significant.
  - **Weedy Species:**
    - **Height:** Positive but not significant.
    - **Count:** Positive but not significant.
  
  **Interpretation:** Low sand content has a more pronounced effect on the height of desirable species than on weedy species, with limited impact on density in either case.

- **Lifeform (Grass, Shrub, etc.):**
  - **Desirable Species:**
    - **Height:** Grasses grow significantly taller, while shrubs do not.
    - **Count:** No significant effects.
  - **Weedy Species:**
    - **Height:** Grasses grow taller; unknown lifeforms have negative effects.
    - **Count:** Grasses increase density; unknown lifeforms decrease it.
  
  **Interpretation:** Grasses tend to dominate in both height and density, particularly in desirable species, suggesting they are a more resilient lifeform in restoration contexts.

### **Summary:**

- **Desirable Species:** 
  - Generally benefit in both height and density from positive environmental conditions like increased precipitation deviation and cumulative precipitation. Treatments like `ConMod` and `Pits` are effective in enhancing density. Desirable species seem adaptable and resilient, particularly in response to precipitation and aridity.

- **Weedy Species:** 
  - Show a more complex response, with increased height under favorable precipitation and aridity, but often with reduced density. This suggests that while individual weedy plants might thrive, their populations could be limited under these conditions, especially in more competitive environments created by cumulative precipitation or other factors.

These insights can guide future restoration efforts, emphasizing the importance of environmental conditions and targeted treatments in promoting desirable species while managing weedy species.


# Northern Arizona Plateau
## 1. All four models compared
I asked it to compare the effect on weedy vs. desirable species on the Northern Arizona Plateau, and gave it results from the four models.

Refers to the model summary output of GLMs with:
 - Random effects of nexted `(1|Site/Plot)` included.
 - Transformation of `AridityIndex` and `Cum_precip` to improve normality.
 - Variables causing collinearity issues have been dropped.
    
Generated on 2024-08-30:
- From `08.1_generalized-linear-models-2.0_subplot-Count.R`:
    - Sonoran Desert, Count, Desirable: `nb.naz.des`
    - Sonoran Desert, Count, Weedy: `nb.naz1.weed`
- From `08.2_generalized-linear-models-2.0_subplot-Height.R`:
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Desirable: `nb.naz.des` model
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Weedy: `nb.naz1.weed` model

One major problem with the response: it thinks that decreasing `Perc_dev_cum` means drier conditions, but that's not really true.

### Response generated:

Let's break down the results to understand the effects on weedy versus desirable species in the Northern Arizona Plateau.

### Desirable Species - Height
- **Significant Effects**:
  - **Perc_dev_cum (-)**: As the percent deviation of cumulative precipitation decreases (indicating drier conditions), the height of desirable species decreases significantly.
  - **PlantSource2Seeded (-)**: Seeded sources have shorter plants compared to other sources.
  - **DurationPerennial (-)**: Perennial plants are shorter.
  - **DurationUnknown (-)**: Plants with unknown duration are also shorter.
  - **LifeformGrass (+)**: Grasses are taller than the reference lifeform.
  - **LifeformShrub (+)**: Shrubs are taller than the reference lifeform.
  - **Cum_precip_sqrt (+)**: More cumulative precipitation increases plant height.

### Weedy Species - Height
- **Significant Effects**:
  - **Perc_dev_cum (-)**: Height decreases with drier conditions.
  - **TreatmentMulch (+)**: Mulching positively affects height.
  - **DurationUnknown (-)**: Plants with unknown duration are shorter.
  - **LifeformGrass (+)**: Grasses are taller.
  - **MAT (+)**: Higher mean annual temperature increases plant height.
  - **Cum_precip_sqrt (+)**: Increased cumulative precipitation positively affects height.

### Desirable Species - Count
- **Significant Effects**:
  - **Perc_dev_cum (+)**: Surprisingly, drier conditions slightly increase the count of desirable species.
  - **PlantSource2Seeded (-)**: Seeded sources have fewer counts.
  - **DurationPerennial (-)**: Perennial species have lower counts.
  - **DurationUnknown (-)**: Species with unknown duration have lower counts.
  - **LifeformGrass (+)**: Grasses have higher counts.
  - **LifeformShrub (-)**: Shrubs have lower counts.
  - **MAT (+)**: Higher temperatures increase the count of desirable species.
  - **Cum_precip_sqrt (+)**: More precipitation increases counts.

### Weedy Species - Count
- **Significant Effects**:
  - **Perc_dev_cum (+)**: Drier conditions increase the count of weedy species significantly.
  - **TreatmentMulch (+)**: Mulching increases the count of weedy species.
  - **TreatmentPits (+)**: Pitting also positively affects weedy species count.
  - **PlotMix_ClimateProjected (+)**: Projected climate mix increases the count.
  - **DurationUnknown (+)**: Species with unknown duration have higher counts.
  - **LifeformGrass (-)**: Grasses have lower counts.
  - **Cum_precip_sqrt (+)**: More precipitation increases counts.

### Summary of Effects
1. **Precipitation (Perc_dev_cum)**:
   - Both desirable and weedy species' height decrease with drier conditions.
   - Counts of both groups tend to increase under drier conditions, especially for weedy species.
   
2. **Lifeform**:
   - Grasses generally tend to be taller across both species groups.
   - The effect on count is mixed; grasses have higher counts for desirable species but lower for weedy species.

3. **Treatment Effects**:
   - Mulching positively affects the height and count of weedy species, but no significant effect is seen in desirable species.

4. **Plant Source**:
   - Seeded sources generally perform worse in terms of height and count for desirable species.

5. **Duration**:
   - Perennial species generally have lower counts and shorter heights, particularly among desirable species.

### Key Takeaways
- **Weedy Species**: They are more opportunistic, increasing in count under drier conditions and with treatments like mulching and pitting. They also respond positively to projected climate scenarios.
- **Desirable Species**: These species are negatively impacted by drier conditions and have reduced performance when seeded. Their counts do increase slightly under drier conditions, but this increase is much less pronounced than in weedy species.

This analysis suggests that managing precipitation, soil treatments, and planting strategies are crucial in controlling the balance between desirable and weedy species in restoration efforts on the Northern Arizona Plateau.

# Sonoran vs. Northern Arizona Plateau
## 1. All eight models compared
I asked it to compare the results of the Sonoran Desert models with the Northern Arizona Plateau ones. I also specified that smaller values of `Perc_dev_cum` don't mean drier conditions, but rather less deviation from average.

Generated on 2024-08-30:
- From `08.1_generalized-linear-models-2.0_subplot-Count.R`:
    - Sonoran Desert, Count, Desirable: `nb.naz.des`
    - Sonoran Desert, Count, Weedy: `nb.naz1.weed`
- From `08.2_generalized-linear-models-2.0_subplot-Height.R`:
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Desirable: `nb.naz.des` model
    - Sonoran Desert, Height, Weedy: `nb.naz1.weed` model

### Response generated:

Given the correction about `Perc_dev_cum`, the synthesis of the results comparing the Sonoran Desert and the Northern Arizona Plateau can be nuanced. 

### Northern Arizona Plateau
- **Desirable Species**:
  - **Height**: Smaller values of `Perc_dev_cum` (indicating more consistent precipitation) are associated with taller plants. Larger deviations (more variability in precipitation) negatively impact height. This suggests that desirable species prefer stable moisture conditions for optimal growth.
  - **Count**: Higher variability in precipitation (`Perc_dev_cum`) appears to be somewhat favorable for the count of desirable species, possibly indicating some resilience or adaptability to variable conditions.

- **Weedy Species**:
  - **Height**: Weedy species show a strong negative response to increasing precipitation variability (`Perc_dev_cum`). They tend to grow shorter under variable moisture conditions, indicating that consistent water availability is crucial for their growth.
  - **Count**: Weedy species seem to proliferate under more stable moisture conditions, with less variability in precipitation. However, they also show some adaptability, as higher counts can occur even under variable conditions.

### Sonoran Desert
- **Desirable Species**:
  - **Height**: The effect of precipitation variability is less pronounced, suggesting that desirable species in the Sonoran Desert might be more tolerant of fluctuations in moisture availability. However, extreme deviations could still negatively impact growth.
  - **Count**: Desirable species in the Sonoran Desert also seem to handle variability well, with counts not being strongly influenced by fluctuations in precipitation.

- **Weedy Species**:
  - **Height**: Similar to the Northern Arizona Plateau, weedy species in the Sonoran Desert show a negative response to variability in precipitation, indicating a preference for consistent moisture conditions.
  - **Count**: Weedy species appear to be less affected by variability, suggesting that their spread is driven more by other factors like soil type, competition, or disturbance rather than just moisture availability.

### Broader Comparison
- **Precipitation Variability (Perc_dev_cum)**: 
  - Across both regions, `Perc_dev_cum` plays a crucial role, with weedy species generally showing a preference for stable conditions, whereas desirable species can sometimes benefit from variability in precipitation, especially in the Northern Arizona Plateau.
  - The **Northern Arizona Plateau** shows more pronounced effects of precipitation variability on both height and count for desirable species compared to the Sonoran Desert, where species seem more resilient to fluctuations.
  
- **Treatment and Other Factors**: 
  - Across both regions, treatment effects on height and count vary, with some treatments like mulching having more consistent positive effects, especially in the Northern Arizona Plateau. The treatment effects are somewhat less pronounced in the Sonoran Desert, where other environmental factors might play a more dominant role.

- **General Resilience**:
  - **Desirable species** in both regions exhibit some level of adaptability, with those in the Northern Arizona Plateau possibly benefiting more from consistent moisture conditions.
  - **Weedy species** tend to struggle more with variability in both regions, but their ability to proliferate under stable conditions is evident.

This synthesis highlights the importance of stable moisture conditions for plant growth, especially for weedy species, while also showing the complex interactions between precipitation variability and plant responses across different desert environments.
