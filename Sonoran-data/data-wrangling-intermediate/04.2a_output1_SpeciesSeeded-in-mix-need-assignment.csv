Sonoran SE,SRER,Medium,"There's a possible POSE (boat/canoe leaf blades, greener than other grasses currently around, it's very basal and tufted too with a membraneous ligule however if it's not than 0% seeded species cover",POSE,Poa secunda,NA
Sonoran SE,SRER,Warm,"Possible ARPUs, SECO seedling in subplot",SECO10,Senna covesii,NA
Sonoran SE,SRER,Warm,Possible young BOCU and ARPU but no seed heads yet therfor unsure ifit is than seeded species cover is 1% but if not it's trace amount because of a few SECOs all found in or near pits,SECO10,Senna covesii,NA

Sonoran SE,SRER,Warm,"Some possible BOCUs but no seed heads, tillers, culms to verify ID yet but if all are BOCUs than it's 2% seeded species cover however if none are than there are a few SECOs throught mostly found in/near the pits",SECO10,Senna covesii,NA
